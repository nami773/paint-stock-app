# paint-stock-app
Django BE &amp; React FE application for managing paint stocks


Although Jane (inventory manager) and paint company painters both need the same permission level, 2 separate roles were created in order to adapt when we need to manage more complex permission levels in future.

The authentication is beyond the scope of this project.
The edits for admin user (Adam) is intentionally omitted, as changing Adam to non-admin account will result in admin functionality unusable in further demo.
